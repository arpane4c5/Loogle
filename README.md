# Loogle : My B.Tech. Project (Apr. 2011 at SRMCEM)

This repository contains code for Loogle: The Local Google. It was my B.Tech. final year project carried out in a group of two members. Some of the code for FTP file sharing was taken from a friend of my project partner. Some of the libraries may be outdated.

The project is built on the lines of DC++. It indexes shared files (over FTP and SMB sharing) and locally hosted websites and provides search results based on keywords. It also provides features like downloading, subscription to servers for email updates when files are updated, crawling the servers at regular intervals of time etc. For details, see the report provided.

## Some points to note

* Database: MySQL

* IDE : Netbeans

* Virtual Machine : RHEL5.4 (for web, mail, DNS, FTP servers)

* Some of the libraries used (see jar files) : Struts, Tiles, Apache-lucene etc.
