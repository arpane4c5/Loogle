# Loogle : My B.Tech. Project (Apr. 2011 at SRMCEM)

This repository contains code for Loogle: The Local Google. It was my B.Tech. final year project carried out in a group of two members. Some of the code for FTP file sharing was taken from a friend of my project partner. Some of the libraries may be outdated.

## Some points to note

* Database: MySQL

* IDE : Netbeans

* Virtual Machine : RHEL5.4 (for web, mail, DNS, FTP servers)

* Some of the libraries used (see jar files) : Struts, Tiles, Apache-lucene etc.
